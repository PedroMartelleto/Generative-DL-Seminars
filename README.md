# Machine Learning Seminars

Jupyter notebooks used to present two seminars about generative deep learning models to my research colleagues from "USP Munic√≠pios". The project, led by professor [Luis Gustavo Nonato](https://sites.icmc.usp.br/gnonato/), analyzes crime patterns at urban settings. The notebooks have been edited to serve as 'slides'. Original code from the book "Generative Deep Learning" by David Foster.
